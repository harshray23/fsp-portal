# Security Policy

The AEC FSP Tracker team and contributors take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in AEC FSP Tracker, please report it to us by emailing `security@example.com` (replace with a real, monitored email address for your project). Please include the following details with your report:

*   A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific configurations or conditions.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that demonstrate the vulnerability.

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a vulnerability report, we will:

1.  Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2.  Investigate the report and determine the severity and validity of the vulnerability.
3.  Work to develop a fix for the vulnerability.
4.  Keep you informed of our progress.
5.  Publicly disclose the vulnerability and the fix after it has been resolved, if appropriate, and credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. The timeline for a fix will depend on the complexity and severity of the issue.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the AEC FSP Tracker application and its codebase.

## Out of Scope

*   Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies should be reported to the respective project maintainers. However, if a vulnerability in a dependency affects this project, please let us know.
*   Social engineering attacks.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that require excessive resources.

## Commitment

We are committed to maintaining the security of our application and appreciate the community's help in this effort. We will make our best effort to respond to and address all reported vulnerabilities in a timely and responsible manner.

Thank you for helping keep AEC FSP Tracker secure!
